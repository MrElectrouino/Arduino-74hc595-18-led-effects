Arduino 74hc595 Shift Register | 16 Led Chaser With 18 Effects
Hello again,

I am thinking about how to control more than 20 led with Arduino Uno because Arduino Uno only has 13 digital pins. So how It's possible? That's why I came with the shift register 74hc595. We need only 3 Arduino digital pins to control LEDs using 74hc595 shift registers. There are 3 part of shift register tutorial.

Control 8 leds.Control leds brightness.Control 2 shiftRegister with led effects. I will explain coding too.

Let Gathering the Component to Build the Arduino 74hc595 Led Chaser.
1. Arduino Uno to the control shift register.
2. Two shift registers 74hc595 for controlling the LEDs.
3. 16 LEDs as an output.
4. 16 resistors to protect the LEDs.
5. Breadboards to build the circuit on it.
6. Jumper wires for connection.
